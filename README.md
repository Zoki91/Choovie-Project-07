# Choovie-Project-07
The Choovie World website is a movie search website which uses two APIâ€™s which call movie data and input this in the page.  
The two APIâ€™s we used were, OMDB and Movie of the night. 
The OMDB API is used to fetch the movie through the OMDB database and the Movie of the Night API is used to fetch the streaming services
